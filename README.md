# Synapse Data Extraction Script

## Overview
This script extracts data from Synapse and converts it to JSON format. I used an existing script as a starting point and added new functions to extract additional data types (e.g., fuel consumption data).

## Tools
Python, SQL.

## Example Code
In the file "synape_to_json_extractor.py" there are some code snippets to show the logic of the extraction process.
