# Synapse Data Extraction Script

## Overview
This script extracts data from Synapse and converts it to JSON format. I used an existing script as a starting point, added new functions to extract additional data types (e.g., GGA data), and learned to use a `.env` file for secure credential management.

## Tools
Python, Jupyter Notebooks, SQL.

## Example Code
In the file "ccc" there are some code snippets to show the logic of the extraction process.
